## Session details

### Building Web Apps with ArcGIS API for JavaScript and Calcite Design System

Learn how you can design a better user experience more efficiently by forming a partnership between designers and developers. In this session, we’ll cover how designers can use Calcite Design System inside Figma (via the Calcite UI Kit) to design the UI/UX, and work with developers to build the same experience in their web app using Calcite web components, icons, and themes. You’ll learn best practices for this collaboration, and practical tips and tricks that we’ve learned though building Esri products.
